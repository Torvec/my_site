A minimalist twist on the classic arcade shooter. Pilot a small ship through space using rotation-based controls and blast incoming asteroids before they hit you. There's no health bar here—one hit and it's game over. Built with Python and Pygame, this barebones version focuses on the core mechanics: rotation, thrust, and survival. Perfect for a quick dose of old-school challenge.

### How to Play

- **W** – Thrust forward
- **S** – Reverse
- **A** – Rotate counter-clockwise
- **D** – Rotate clockwise
- **Space** – Shoot

Avoid all asteroids and survive as long as you can. One hit ends the run.
