Take control of a fiery little pup in this lighthearted 2D side-scrolling action game. Run, jump, and roast your way through five short levels and a final boss fight using a handful of fire-powered moves. Whether you’re tossing fireballs or rolling into enemies like a blazing cannonball, it’s all about timing, reflexes, and a bit of trial and error. Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript and canvas, it’s a simple but complete experience—menus, music, sound effects, and a score system included. No downloads needed—just hop in and see how high you can score.

## How to Play

Use the keyboard to control your fiery canine hero:

- **A / D** – Move left and right
- **W** – Jump
- **S** – Sit (or duck)
- **Space** – Shoot a fireball
- **Shift** – Perform a rolling fireball attack (requires charge)
- **W + S (while midair)** – Perform a ground pound attack

Shooting enemies helps charge up your roll attack.

Each level is timed, your goal is to survive until the timer runs out while defeating enemies and aiming for the highest score possible. Good luck!
