## About

I'm currently located in the San Francisco Bay Area of California.

I specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript for both front-end and back-end development, with experience in Python and Go. I'm always broadening my horizons with new techniques and technologies.

## Personal Interests

Besides programming, I also enjoy running, hiking, traveling, pc gaming, pc building, cooking, and watching movies and anime.
