It's the day after Christmas 2024, and I'm putting the finishing touches on this blog that I created as an opportunity to learn how to use Astro, give Vue a try, and have a place to practice writing. Everything has gone relatively smoothly so far since Astro's development experience (DX) is top tier, and my experience with React made working with Vue hassle-free. Granted, I've only built one small Vue component, which controls the light/dark theme switching, using `useDark()` and `useToggle()` from the [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) library. The only other experience I have with Vue is from watching the [Vue.js Crash Course 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeNfHj6MhgA) video from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia), and the [Adding a Dark Mode to Vue in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGN91TLXrC8) video by [LearnVue](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnVue), which explains how to set up a theme switcher. I'm excited to use Vue, and maybe Nuxt eventually, in future projects along with Astro, so stay tuned!
